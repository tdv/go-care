# Redis Greeter

The example demonstrates the same features as the ['greeter'](https://github.com/tdv/go-care/tree/main/examples/greeter)
example, but uses Redis like an external cache.

All cases are equal to the ['greeter'](https://github.com/tdv/go-care/tree/main/examples/greeter) example.  
Regarding Redis usage this example you can consider as something that is close to be used in production.

**Note**
Before testing the example you need to install Redis or run the one like a docker image. Everything for docker-based
Redis usage you'll find in the 'redis-docker' folder.
